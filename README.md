Building a website gallery with ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, React and NodeJS

This project is mainly based on blog article posted by Novu - https://novu.co/blog/building-a-website-gallery-with-chatgpt-stable-diffusion-react-and-node-js/

ChatGPT is also an AI language model trained by OpenAI to generate text and interact with users in a human-like conversational manner. Users can submit requests and get information or answers to questions from a wide range of topics such as history, science, mathematics, and current events in just a few seconds.</br></br>
Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image latent diffusion model that enables users to generate images within a few seconds based on a given text input. It is also used in processes such as in-painting, out-painting, and generating image-to-image translations.</br></br>

In this app we are going to create images from text using the Stable Diffusion WebUI and send messages to ChatGPT from a Node.js application.
